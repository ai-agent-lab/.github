</div>

A comprehensive evaluation of OpenAI's new open-source language models (GPT-OSS) with two variants: 120B and 20B parameter models. Our research challenges traditional scaling assumptions by demonstrating that the smaller 20B model often outperforms the larger 120B variant across multiple benchmarks.

**Key Contributions:**

- Evaluation against six contemporary open-source large language models
- Benchmarking across ten different evaluation categories
- Analysis of performance in general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation, multilingual understanding, and conversational ability
- Surprising finding: GPT-OSS-20B outperforms GPT-OSS-120B on several benchmarks
